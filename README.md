# Energy Monitor Project

---

Project for collecting, analyzing & visualising data related to energy generation in the UK.

Our main goals are to collect data on energy generation, usage, carbon emissions, price and power outages and display them either via an interactable dashboard, as a newsletter, or as a notification.

## Development

- Features should be worked on in their own branch. Once passed by QA, can be merged into main.
- No broken, erroneous or 'bad' code should be in a PR.
- Code should follow industry best practices. For Python this means PEP8, and should be linted at every step.
- Code should be clear and documented where necessary.
